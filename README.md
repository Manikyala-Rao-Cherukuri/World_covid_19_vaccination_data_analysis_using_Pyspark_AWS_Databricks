# World_covid_19_vaccination_data_analysis_using_Pyspark_AWS_Databricks
#### Description: 
This project involves analysing the world covid-19 vaccination data using Pyspark and SparkSQL on Databricks along with AWS to draw analytical insights from it.
- First fetching the covid-19 free dataset, which is available on Kaggle and then loading that csv file into AWS S3 bucket using AWS CLI.
- Using community edition of Databricks account to establish the connection between the Databricks and AWS S3 storage bucket with help of AWS access and secret keys from the notebook.
- On Databricks, I have drawn the insights over the vaccination data like total vaccination per country, total vaccinations per million and top 10 countries where majority people got vaccinates etc.
- I have uploaded covid-19 data to tableau and created the dashboard to distinguish the vaccination data over multiple countries. This the public dashboard link
#### Key Technologies/ Skills:
